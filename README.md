# Art: `sellf.org`

## Statement

### Sellf.org

`sellf.org` is a company that explores the ramifications of the commodification of personal data, by operating a free for-sale-by-owner data market. The premise: "Who's better equipped to sell your data than you are?"

By revealing the market value of consumer data, `sellf.org` creates and investigates a world where consumerism can be self supporting. Can you make a living by publishing how you spend that living?

More importantly, `sellf.org` seeks to attack the current form of the relationship between Big Data Collection and the public.

By engaging the public through a commerical, rather than an art context, the company seeks to surface the conversation about personal commoditization.

It forces people to consider questions personally that an art-framed piece couldn't ('what am I getting paid for?' 'What will happen if I sell this?' 'How much will I sell my data for?' 'What is my privacy worth?') by making the public examine the potential repercussions of a conscious contract rather than a passive one.

## For sellers

There's an enormous market for data about youâ€”your location, your purchasing habits, your interests. Many of the websites and services you use, the stores you visit, and the devices you carry are constantly scrambling to collect this data and sell it to the highest bidder.

But nobody has more access to valuable data about you than you do.

With Sellf, you can create a data product far more valuable than what anyone else could collect. Companies like Facebook and Google put millions of dollars into correlating datasets together, but you can sell all of your data as a single package. Google and Facebook can't compete.

## For buyers

Data mining allows us to advertise more cheaply and effectively than ever thought possible. Don't just target demographics, target conditions: `just stopped at atm`, `good mood`, `hungry`, `drunk`.

By collecting all of a consumer's data from every source with consent, `sellf.org` offers a revolutionary data resolution, enabling you to sell many times more for every advertising dollar.

### thoughts

I'm not sure who to address on the `buy` page.

#### option 1

I could position sellf.org as a traditional marketing data sales company, selling huge datasets to corporate interests.

This approach most directly engages with the current personal data market. On the other hand, as far as I've turned up, most of the huge data collectors (amazon, google, facebook) sell data indirectly via an advertising platform rather than as a dataset.

A person has many datagrams which are (can be?) sold together. A buyer makes an order like "the cheapest hundred people who spend more than 100k per year and offer location and purchase data with >90% completeness", and it's filled based on how sellers set their prices.

#### option 2

On the other hand, it would be interesting to create a data market targetted more towards artists + hobbyists rather than marketing departments. Allowing people to submit arbitrary types/sets of data will help the ecosystem grow autonomously.

#### Data types

I'm not sure how to go about supporting the broad range of data people might have. On one hand, if I offer a limited set of data types and (for example) require pictures to be a flickr album it eliminates storage costs and makes it easier for buyers but harder for me to implement. If I accept data as any url, I can work on things like scraping flickrs(whatever). If I accept any file it's super open but also super costly.

I think I'll start with the minimum viable product angle and just take URIs.

## What happens to data collected online anyway?

I honestly expected to be able to go online and find some page where I could buy a huge dataset from facebook or something. I haven't been able to find anything of the kind. Data collectors monetize their data through ad platforms.
